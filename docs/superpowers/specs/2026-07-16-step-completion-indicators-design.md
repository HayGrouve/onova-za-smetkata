# Step Completion Indicators — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-07-16  
**Status:** Approved  
**Scope:** Visual “done” state on the bill editor step progress bar when each step has the required data; free navigation unchanged  
**Approach:** 1 — Pure completion helper + thin `BillStepsBar` props  
**Builds on:** Existing `BillStepsBar`, `validateBillForFinalize`, editor route `?step=`

---

## Problem

The top step bar only shows how far the host has *navigated* (`segment ≤ current step`). It does not show whether each step’s required data is filled, so progress through the bill is harder to scan at a glance.

## Solution

Derive per-step completion from live bill data and color the existing four segment bars:

- **Current** step → primary (even if that step is also complete)
- **Other** steps → success if done, muted if incomplete

Hosts can still jump to any step. No persisted flags; no check icons.

## UX decisions

| Topic | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Done criteria | Minimal basics (option A) |
| Visual language | Color only (option C) — no checkmarks |
| vs old “reached” fill | Hybrid (option C): current always primary; others done vs incomplete only |
| Updates | Live from bill query / editor state |
| Navigation | Unchanged — any step tappable |
| Persistence | None — derived from data |

## Done rules

| Step | Label | Done when |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Бележка | `restaurantName.trim()` non-empty |
| 2 | Участници | `participants.length ≥ 1` |
| 3 | Разпределение | ≥1 item **and** every item has at least one assignment |
| 4 | Преглед | `validateBillForFinalize(...)` returns no errors |

### Step 3 vs step 4

- Step 3 does **not** require restaurant name or participants.
- Step 3 treats “assigned” as presence of ≥1 assignment row per item (same idea as the unassigned-items finalize check). Unit-count mismatches for qty > 1 are **not** required for step 3 done; they still block step 4 via finalize validation.
- Step 4 is exactly finalize-ready (restaurant, ≥1 participant, ≥1 priced item, no unassigned items, units match when unit assignments are used).

### Edge cases

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Empty new bill | All incomplete except possibly none; current step primary |
| Host auto-participant present | Step 2 done immediately when that participant exists |
| Zero-price items | Step 3: still need an assignment if the item exists; step 4 still requires ≥1 priced item per finalize |
| Finalized bill (forced step 4) | Same colors; typically all done if finalize was allowed |
| Local draft restaurant name before save | Prefer the same value the editor shows (controlled field / bill doc after sync) so the bar matches what the host sees |

## Bar color matrix

| Condition | Class |
|-----------|--------|
| `s === currentStep` | `bg-primary` |
| `s !== currentStep` && done | `bg-success` |
| `s !== currentStep` && !done | `bg-border` |

Caption under the bar stays: `Стъпка {n} · {label}`.

### Accessibility

- Keep `aria-current="step"` on the current segment.
- Extend each segment `aria-label` to include completion, e.g. `Стъпка 2: Участници, завършена` / `…, незавършена`.
- Color is not the only signal (label text in accessible name).

---

## Architecture

### New

- `getBillStepCompletion(input) → Record<BillStep, boolean>` (or tuple) in shared/lib next to bill validation.
  - Input: restaurant name, participants, items, assignments (same shapes finalize uses where possible).
  - Step 4 delegates to `validateBillForFinalize(input).length === 0`.
  - Unit tests for each step’s true/false cases.

### Modified

- `BillStepsBar`: accept `completed: Record<BillStep, boolean>` (or `readonly boolean[]` length 4); apply color matrix; richer `aria-label`.
- Bill editor route (`src/routes/bills/$billId/index.tsx`): `useMemo` completion from bill data (+ local restaurant field if that is the displayed source of truth); pass into `BillStepsBar`.

### Unchanged

- `goToStep` / search `step` / `StepNavBar`
- Finalize mutation and error list on step 4
- Guest join/claim routes (no host step bar)

```
bill data → getBillStepCompletion → BillStepsBar(completed, step)
```

---

## Out of scope

- Preventing navigation to incomplete steps
- Check icons / extra glyphs on the bar
- Changing `validateBillForFinalize` rules
- Persisting completion flags on the bill
- Guest-facing step UI

---

## Testing

### Unit

- Step 1: empty vs trimmed name
- Step 2: zero vs one participant
- Step 3: no items; item without assignment; all assigned
- Step 4: mirrors finalize (missing restaurant still fails step 4 even if step 3 done)

### Manual

- Fill restaurant → step 1 turns success when leaving it (or while on 2–4)
- Add participant → step 2 success
- Add item + assign → step 3 success
- Satisfy finalize → step 4 success
- Jump freely between steps; current always primary

---

## Success criteria

1. Host can see at a glance which steps have required data.
2. Current step remains visually distinct (primary).
3. Navigation is never blocked by completion.
4. Step 4 done matches ability to finalize (same validator).
