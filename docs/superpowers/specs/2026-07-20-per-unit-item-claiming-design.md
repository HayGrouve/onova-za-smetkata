# Per-unit item claiming — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-07-20  
**Status:** Complete (locked for implementation handoff)  
**Scope:** Replace exclusive whole-unit claiming for quantity > 1 with per-unit membership so identical items can be split differently  
**Map:** [Per-unit item claiming spec](https://github.com/HayGrouve/onova-za-smetkata/issues/34)  
**Prototype:** branch `prototype/spodeli-modal` @ `765516f` — `/prototype/spodeli-modal?variant=A`  
**Builds on:** guest claim flow, claim share drawer, step-completion indicators, finalize read-only  
**Domain:** `CONTEXT.md` — **Unit**, **Unit index**, **Participant**, **Guest**, **Share**

---

## Problem

Today, quantity > 1 lines use exclusive whole-unit claiming (`units` count per participant). Two bottles of water cannot be shared differently (e.g. one split, one solo). The product needs independently claimable **units** with any-size participant sets per unit.

## Solution

Quantity > 1 is a stack of independently claimable **units**. Membership is stored per `(item, participant, unitIndex)`. Claiming for qty > 1 happens in a **Сподели** centered dialog of stacked unit cards; qty = 1 keeps today’s toggle. Empty units are allowed in draft and forbidden at finalize.

---

## Product locks (do not re-litigate)

| Topic | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Quantity > 1 | Stack of independently claimable units; no cap on participants per unit |
| Same participant | May join multiple units on one line |
| Split within a unit | Even split only (same remainder spirit as today’s qty = 1 share) |
| Claim UX | Host + guests; qty > 1 via **Сподели → modal**; qty = 1 keeps today’s toggle |
| Empty units | Forbidden at finalize; allowed temporarily in draft |
| Quantity ↑ | Adds empty trailing units |
| Quantity ↓ | Drops trailing units + their memberships |
| Exclusive claiming | Replaced for qty > 1 |
| Migration | None — wipe existing claim data; new shape only from day one |

**Out of scope for this feature:** weighted/custom fractions within a unit; participant cap per unit; redesign of qty = 1 claiming; host “assign shares for others” beyond existing claim-mode patterns; end-to-end implementation (this document is the handoff).

## Data shape

Replaces exclusive `units` on `itemAssignments`.

**Target row:** `{ billId, itemId, participantId, unitIndex }`

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | One membership row per `(itemId, participantId, unitIndex)` — join inserts, leave deletes |
| `unitIndex` | Zero-based, `0 … quantity−1` |
| Quantity = 1 | Same shape with `unitIndex: 0` (UI may keep simple toggle) |
| Uniqueness | At most one row per triple |
| Even-split | Over participants that share the same `(itemId, unitIndex)` |
| Multi-unit | A participant may hold multiple rows for the same item (different indexes) |

**Ship prerequisite:** reset Convex / clear `itemAssignments` (and related claim data). No backfill, no dual-read/write.

**Ticket:** [How is unit membership stored?](https://github.com/HayGrouve/onova-za-smetkata/issues/35), [How do draft bills migrate off exclusive units?](https://github.com/HayGrouve/onova-za-smetkata/issues/38)

## Claim UI

### Parent row (quantity > 1), outside Сподели

| Element | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | Name, unit price × quantity, line total (unchanged) |
| My involvement | If joined ≥1 unit → selected styling + count; if 0 → omit count, no selected styling |
| Line glance | Unit coverage only (units with ≥1 participant). No other names on the parent |
| Money | No aggregate „Вашият дял“ on the parent |
| Action | Whole row opens Сподели; visible CTA; no inline join/stepper |

**Read-only (final / viewing):** same parent summary; modal still opens for inspection; join/leave disabled inside.

**Ticket:** [What does the parent item row show outside Сподели?](https://github.com/HayGrouve/onova-za-smetkata/issues/36)

### Сподели modal (quantity > 1)

Centered **dialog**; vertical stack of unit rows, each like today’s quantity = 1 claim card:

- Title: item name + 1-based unit label; unit price on the row
- Tap toggles current participant join/leave on that unit
- Selected styling + „✓ Ваше“ when joined
- Other participants visible; empty-unit hint when none
- Per-unit share preview on each unit row
- Join / leave hint on the card

Rejected alternatives: bottom-drawer checklist; one-unit-at-a-time stepper.

**Ticket:** [Сподели modal lists units as separate item rows](https://github.com/HayGrouve/onova-za-smetkata/issues/37)

---

## Finalize and step completion

**Coverage predicate:** for every item (including zero-price), every unit index `0 … quantity−1` has ≥1 participant.

| Surface | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Finalize | Must pass the predicate |
| Step 3 | Done only when ≥1 item and predicate holds for every item |
| Host unassigned cue | Count of items that fail the predicate |
| Error | Replace `units_mismatch` with `empty_units` (count items that still have an empty unit) |

Unchanged: step 4 / all-paid / restaurant / participants. Writers keep `unitIndex` in range on quantity change.

**Ticket:** [How do finalize and step-completion treat per-unit claims?](https://github.com/HayGrouve/onova-za-smetkata/issues/39)

## Bulgarian copy

### Parent row (quantity > 1)

| Slot | Copy |
| --- | --- |
| My involvement (only if N ≥ 1) | `Ваши бройки: {N} от {Q}` |
| Coverage (only if covered ≥ 1) | `{covered} от {Q} заети` |
| CTA | `Сподели` |

No extra invite line when N = 0.

### Сподели modal (stacked unit cards)

| Slot | Copy |
| --- | --- |
| Dialog title | `Сподели · {name}` |
| Unit title | `{name} · бройка {n}` (1-based) |
| Joined | `✓ Ваше` |
| Others on unit | `Споделено с {names} ({1 човек` / `N души`})` — same count helper as qty = 1 |
| Empty unit | `Празна бройка` |
| Share preview | `Вашият дял: {amount}` |
| Not joined hint | `Присъедини се` |
| Joined hint | `Докоснете, за да излезете` |

### Breakdown / share-text / finalize

| Surface | Copy |
| --- | --- |
| Claim/summary breakdown suffix (qty > 1) | ` · {N} от {Q}` (N = units joined by that participant) |
| Share-text per person on qty > 1 line | `{name} {n} бр. ({amount})` — n = units joined; amount = their total Share on that item |
| Fully uncovered item in share-text | `неразпределено` |
| Finalize / validation (`empty_units`) | `Има 1 неразпределен артикул.` / `Има {N} неразпределени артикула.` |
| Host chip | `{N} неразпределени` |

**Ticket:** [What Bulgarian copy describes multi-unit involvement?](https://github.com/HayGrouve/onova-za-smetkata/issues/41)

## Concurrent claims and quantity edits

Locked defaults (former map fog):

| Topic | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Concurrent join/leave on the same unit | Insert/delete membership row; last successful mutation wins; no special locking beyond existing Convex mutation semantics |
| Host item-edit quantity after claims started | Standing rules: qty ↑ adds empty trailing units; qty ↓ drops trailing units + memberships |
| Receipt / item-list replace | Keep today’s wipe-assignments behavior when the item list is replaced |

---

## Implementation notes (non-normative)

Suggested touch points (not a task breakdown):

- Schema / `itemAssignments` writers and readers (`convex/assignments.ts`, share math in `shared/bill-calculations.ts`)
- Claim parent row + Сподели dialog (`guest-item-row` / claim route)
- Finalize validation + step 3 (`validateBillForFinalize`, `getBillStepCompletion`, host unassigned count)
- Breakdown / share-text formatters (`bill-share.ts`)
- Wipe claim data before shipping the new shape

Use the prototype on `prototype/spodeli-modal` as visual reference for Variant A only; rewrite properly for production (no prototype switcher).

---

## Acceptance (handoff)

Implementation is done when:

1. Qty > 1 claiming uses per-unit membership and the Сподели stacked-card dialog.
2. Qty = 1 claiming behavior is unchanged in product terms.
3. Finalize, step 3, and host unassigned use full unit coverage.
4. Copy matches the tables above.
5. No exclusive `units` field remains in the live assignment shape; data was wiped, not migrated.
